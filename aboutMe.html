    <h1>Brief presentation</h1>

        Hi, my name is Riccardo, and I was born on 25th November 2002 in Andria. I'm a computer science student at the University of Trento and a music enthusiast. In this presentation, I will introduce you to my two passions - music and computer science. <br>
        My love for music began at a very young age. I grew up in a family where music was always around me. My parents are both music lovers, and they introduced me to different genres of music at a very early age. As I grew older, I developed my taste in music and started exploring different genres on my own. Music is more than just a hobby for me; it's a way of life. It helps me to relax and unwind after a long day of studying. I listen to a wide range of music, from classical to modern, and I always discover something new and exciting in each genre. <br>
        My love for computer science began during my teenage years. I got my diploma from ITIS Sen.Onofrio Jannuzzi, a great school with 100L/100, and it provided me with an excellent foundation in computer science. At the University of Trento, I am further expanding my knowledge and skills in different areas, including algorithms, programming languages, and artificial intelligence.My love for computer science began during my teenage years.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring other topics related to computer science, such as cybersecurity and data science. I'm always seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.
