        I was born in Andria, Italy in 2002. Actually I'm a Computer Science student at University of Trento, before this experience I got my diploma from ITIS Sen.Onofrio Jannuzzi of Andria.
        I love different things but I think that two of the things that I love the most in my life are Music and Computer Science. Love for the music was born as a child and actually I have at least twelve thousand songs saved in my Spotify, I love every musical genre and I love discover music everyday.
        Instead, love for the Computer Science was born during the years of my life, I always been a tinkerer but my curiosity during the years led me to discover this passion. I think that I discovered and studied a lot of information and concepts about this enormous topic but I think that "we must never stop to discover things".
